You can find a Chrome extension that will modify CORS headers on the fly in your application.  Extension name is   Access-Control-Allow-Origin. I recommend you to disable this extension when you not working on your stuff, because, for example, youtube does not work with this extension.   https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi
